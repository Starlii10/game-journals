            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Minecraft is a sandbox game initially developed by Markus "Notch" Persson. It was first developed by Mojang in 2009 before fully releasing in 2011.</p>
                <p>Multiple versions of the game exist, such as the Legacy Console Editions for PS3, PS4, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, and Xbox One, and Bedrock Edition for PC and most consoles (as well as mobile and PC). This journal entry is specifically about the Java Edition for PC, the original version of the game.</p>
                <p>Minecraft has two main game modes: Survival, where you must gather materials and defeat monsters to survive, and Creative, where you can build anything you want with unlimited resources without worrying about damage.</p>
                <p>The game has gone through many updates, with some more recent ones being Caves and Cliffs (1.17 and 1.18), the Wild Update (1.19), Trails & Tales (1.20) and Tricky Trials (1.21). This journal entry isn't about any specific version, because going through them all would be awful.</p>
                <p>Minecraft is also known for its community servers, with custom game modes such as Bedwars, Skywars, Kit PVP, and Hide and Seek. There are thousands of servers to join and play on at any time!</p>
            <h3>Shenanigans</h3>
                <p>"Minecraft" and "shenanigans" should never exist in the same sentence. However, I must inform of the chaos you're getting into.</p>
                <p>First off, the game mechanics can occasionally confuse you, to the point where you'll probably want a guide. For example, why does Soul Sand in water make a bubble column that pushes you up?</p>
                <p>There's a whole world of customization in this game. Resource and data packs are easy to make and provide a lot of control over the game, and you can use Java and a mod loader like Forge or Fabric to put whatever you want in the game.</p>
                <p>Minecraft is way more fun with friends. I've played on many servers before, and it was probably the most fun I ever had. I think I stayed up until 3 AM playing on a server once.</p>
                <p>There's a whole bunch of versions of this game, so if you don't like a specific version, just downgrade to whatever you want! You can even downgrade to the early 2009 builds if you really wanna.</p>
            <h3>Rating</h3>
                <p>No amount of rating this game will do it justice. But this is Starlii speaking, and doing things I shouldn't do is my thing.</p>
                <p>There's really no plot, so I'm replacing this section with customization. Which it gets a 9/10 for, simply because resource and data packs alone already give plenty of customization.</p>
                <p>If I could give the gameplay an 11/10, I'd do it. Heck, I would give it a 100/10. But alas, the rating is out of 10, so I must give a 10/10.</p>
                <p>Bugs don't really show themselves unless you're specifically looking for them, and they're usually pretty harmless. The game is fairly unoptimized, though, but mods can improve that. 9.5/10.</p>
                <p>There's no way I would give Minecraft of all games anything but a...</p>
            <h2>9.5 - Would SEVERELY recommend</h2>
                <p>If you haven't touched this game, go spend $28 on it immediately. This is not a joke. It's THAT good.</p>
