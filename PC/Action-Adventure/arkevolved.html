            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>ARK: Survival Evolved is a survival game about dinosaurs and primitive technology. Except there's also modern and even futuristic technology too.</p>
                <p>It has quite a bit of content, especially with the DLCs. Each DLC is a whole new map to play on, and there's even some community-made ones that are free to grab!</p>
                <p>Like all survival games, you have to not die. Punch trees, mine rocks, tame dinosaurs, and build. </p>
                <p>Sadly, this game's official servers have been shut off in favor of the newer ARK: Survival Ascended. Single-player is still really fun, though.</p>
                <p>If you're on Steam, there's even some mods. But I mainly play this game vanilla, so I'm not gonna go into that a whole lot.</p>
                <p>This game also has some form of VR support? I've never used it because I can't quite get it working, but it exists.</p>
            <h3>Shenanigans</h3>
                <p>ARK is where shenanigans live and thrive. This game's terrible code leads to some funny, or at least questionable, behaviour.</p>
                <p>First, this is a game where you'll most likely need a guide. There's a ton of stuff in the game, and a lot of the progression is locked behind going to specific locations on a giant map.</p>
                <p>Also, yeah, it's ARK. Therefore, prepare your PC to become a jet engine. I wouldn't even recommend playing it on anything other than PC, because it lags too hard to be enjoyable. And they also decided to put it on the Switch, which... yeah, that's painful.</p>
                <p>This game was one of the main reasons I bought an RTX 3060. Even with that, it's still quite laggy at times, and high graphics are absolutely not happening.</p>
                <p>The bugginess of this game has become a meme. If you see me referring to this game when speaking of performance on another game, it usually means it's horribly optimized, just like this game.</p>
            <h3>Rating</h3>
                <p>No amount of rating this game will do it justice. But this is Starlii speaking, and doing things I shouldn't do is my thing.</p>
                <p>The plot is great for a survival game. I think the blend between primitive and futuristic is an interesting idea. 9/10.</p>
                <p>Gameplay is very good, but it's not very fun. You basically just grind a whole bunch. Which some people find fun, but I don't. So this is a 7/10.</p>
                <p>I've already described how buggy this game is. No surprise it gets a 3/10.</p>
                <p>I guess it's a decent game despite how incredibly broken it is.</p>
            <h2>7 - Would kinda recommend</h2>
                <p>If you see this game on sale, consider buying it. Or just get Xbox Game Pass.</p>
