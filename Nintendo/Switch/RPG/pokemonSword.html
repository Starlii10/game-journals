            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Pokémon Sword and Shield, known collectively as Pokémon Gen 8, are role-playing games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The games released in 2019, with two additional DLC named "The Isle of Armor" and "The Crown Tundra" both releasing in 2020.</p>
                <p>I'll add more info here. If I don't do so within a week, tell me on GitHub, please.</p>
            <h3>Shenanigans</h3>
                <p>Oh dear. This is definitely a video game, and the amount of shenanigans I've done within it shows.</p>
                <p>I should probably go ahead and put a disclaimer here that this was the first Pokémon game I fully played through. I had played Yellow before on my 3DS, but I never completely beat it. So this is from the experience of someone who wasn't exactly the best at Pokémon, and definitely not from the perspective of someone who's played many different Pokémon games. Take everything I say with a grain of salt.</p>
                <p>So, this was the first Pokémon game on the Switch, and the first game to use Pokémon Home (a successor to Pokémon Bank for the now-dead 3DS). I never used Bank because it was a subscription, but you get a permanent free Box in Home, and I've used it more times than I can count.</p>
                <p>The whole Raid Battle idea was executed great, but they forgot that it gives EXP Candies. If you've ever played a Pokémon game and used those, you know what that means. (Hint: yes, level 100 Pokémon are involved.)</p>
                <p>There's also a postgame where you get to use Zacian/Zamazenta some more, as if beating up the Champion with a legendary wasn't enough for you. Though, if I really wanted to use my legendary, I would have probably beaten literally ANYONE up. Or maybe I would have bought another game and used Zacian there (although there were no other games at the time).</p>
            <h3>Rating</h3>
                <p>Insert funny joke about rating this game here. Or something like that.</p>
                <p>The plot was great. Mostly about finding out what happened with Zacian/Zamazenta. Darkest Day this, Ancient Sword that. Slowly putting the pieces together until the end. 8/10!</p>
                <p>The gameplay? I personally love the Wild Area and its focus on an open-world experience. The Dynamax feature added a lot more strategy to battles. And of course, Raid Battles are great besides taking forever to do. 9/10.</p>
                <p>Bugginess? Never heard of it. I haven't encountered any serious glitches and the game runs fine unlike the next game(s) in the series. I'm giving this one a 9/10.</p>
                <p>And the final rating comes out to...</p>
            <h2>8.5/10</h2>
                <p>I'd suggest this game to Pokémon enthusiasts who want to play more Pokémon games on the Switch, or to those who need a home for their Pokémon they got through Pokémon Home.</p>
