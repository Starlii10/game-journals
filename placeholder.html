        <h1>Placeholder</h1>
        <p>If you're here, it's most likely because you tried to access a placeholder page.</p>
        <p>This is basically a 404 page without the 404, because I don't know how to handle 404s.</p>
        <p>I guess I can give a link to the <a href="/game-journals/index.html">home page</a>. If you wanna go there. Or not. I'm not your dad.</p>
