# Starlii's Game Journals

Video games, but with HUMOR.

## About

This website is for me to share my thoughts and findings in video games I've played. These can be anything from best-seller AAA games to games from the smallest indie developers. I rate the games based on my own personal experiences with them, and do challenges sometimes.

While yes, the stuff I write and do is a bit... insane at times, I try my best to be as serious as possible. (The previous statement was a lie. I'm never serious.)

## Why?

I've always wanted to make a personal website like this. I'm not very good at it (I recently did a web development course), but I can do basic HTML and CSS, maybe some JavaScript if I really feel like it.

Why did I publish this website? Well, mostly as a joke. Maybe if more people start viewing this site I'll work on it some more.

## Current State

This website is made very terribly. I tried on organizing it, but I don't think I did a great job.

There's 4 entries right now, with plans to do more. That is, if I don't lose interest in this project.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome (such as fixing my horrible HTML or CSS). If you find things in games I've done where you think it deserves an entry in the site somewhere, let me know about it!
