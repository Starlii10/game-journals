# Starlii's Game Journals

Video games, but with HUMOR.

## About

This website is for me to share my thoughts and findings in video games I've played. These can be anything from best-seller AAA games to games from the smallest indie developers. I rate the games based on my own personal experiences with them, and do challenges sometimes.

## Why?

I've always wanted to make a personal website like this. I'm not very good at it (I've just finished up a web development course), but I can do basic HTML and CSS, maybe some JavaScript if I really feel like it.

Why did I publish this website? Well, mostly as a joke. Maybe if more people start viewing this site I'll work on it some more.

## Current State

This website has 3 entries so far. There's a home page as well, and a stylesheet I totally made myself. Other than that, it's fairly empty right now, but it will grow in time!

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome (such as fixing my horrible HTML or CSS). If you find things in games I've done where you think it deserves an entry in the site somewhere, let me know about it!
